    <h2> Fizz Buzz </h2>
    <p> 
        This is a javascript program that loops between numbers 1-50. If:
        <ul>
            <li> A number is divisible by 3, Fizz is printed. </li>
            <li> A number is divisible by 5, Buzz is printed. </li>
            <li> A number is divisible by both, Fizz Buzz is printed. </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
